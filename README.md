### Secondly, we created a Textual Sentiment Analysis model of top 25 headlines of particular company and predicted wheather this news can effect the stock price of the company or not, and using CountVectoirzer and RandomForest we trained our model and predict. The accuracy is also being checked using confusion matrix plotted.
